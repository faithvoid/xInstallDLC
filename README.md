# xInstallDLC
DLC Installer for the original Xbox - Based on ENDGAME, intended for installing DLC on "stock" or lightly-softmodded systems.

## How to Use:
- Extract xInstallDLC onto a FATX-formatted USB-drive (can be made with FatXPlorer on Windows, or libfatx on Linux. I would personally recommend running a Hiren's Boot CD virtual machine if you don't have a physical Windows machine.)
- Insert USB into Xbox via a controller port to USB adapter (Any generic should work, but an adapter can be easily made yourself if you don't want to shell out $3-$4)
- Go into the "Memory" menu on the Xbox, then select "Memory Card". The menu should hang for a few seconds and xInstallDLC should launch.
- Select the DLC that you'd like to install, press A, wait for it to launch it's respective .XBE file and follow the instructions there.
- Restart your Xbox, there should be no traces of any homebrew left and you'll have signed DLC for your games!
